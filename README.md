# Advanced Algorithms Project - Fibonacci Heaps

This repo contains three components:

1. Benchmarking Dijkstra's Algorithm: `dijkstra/`
   - Fibonacci heaps vs STL's priority_queue
  
2. xv6Scheduling: `./simulatedBenching/`
   - Implemented fibonacci heaps in xv6
   - Random process generator 

3. Benchmarking Simulated Process Scheduling: `./xv6Scheduling/`
    - Random process synthesized
    - Processes scheduled using priority queues
    - Priority Queues using Fibonacci heaps vs binary heaps
  
Each Directory has it's own `README.md`, containing instructions on executing the programs.
